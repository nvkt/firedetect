# Version 1.0.0 - Base Model with Data Verification

## Key Features

- **Separate Training/Validation Structure**: Implemented distinct directories for training and validation datasets
- **Data Verification System**: Added interactive tool for dataset cleaning and verification
- **Enhanced Visualizations**:
  - Grouped bar plots showing distribution across both training and validation sets
  - Sample image grid from training data
  - Training history with accuracy and loss curves
  - Confusion matrix for model evaluation

## Directory Structure Changes
```
data/
├── train/          # Training data (previously was root level)
│   ├── fire/
│   └── no_fire/
└── validation/     # New validation split (previously handled by ImageDataGenerator)
    ├── fire/
    └── no_fire/
```

## Technical Improvements

- Removed automatic validation split from ImageDataGenerator in favor of explicit validation directory
- Added error handling for missing directories and empty datasets
- Implemented non-interactive matplotlib backend support for headless environments
- Added statistics printing for both training and validation sets

## Known Limitations

- Small initial dataset size
- Basic data augmentation parameters
- Single GPU training only
- No distributed training support

## Next Steps

1. Create branch for expanded dataset training
2. Create branch for advanced data augmentation techniques
3. Create branch for multi-GPU support
4. Create branch for Raspberry Pi optimization
