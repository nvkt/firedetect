# Program Requirements Document (PRD)

**Project Title:**  
Wildfire Detection AI/ML Vision Model

**Version:**  
1.0

**Date:**  
*[Insert Date]*

---

## 1. Introduction

This document specifies the requirements and overall flow for the development of a Python-based AI/ML system that classifies images of forests as either containing a wildfire ("fire") or not ("no fire"). The project will be delivered in multiple deployments:

- **Phase 1:** A fully functional backend AI/ML model that can be trained on and infer from images.
- **Phase 2:** Integration with a webcam to enable real-time fire detection from live video input.
- **Phase 3:** Deployment on a Raspberry Pi with a camera module for on-site monitoring (implementation for Raspberry Pi is to be planned but not developed at this time).

---

## 2. Purpose and Scope

### 2.1 Purpose
- **Objective:** Automate the detection of wildfires using image classification.
- **Outcome:** Enable early detection of wildfires to help initiate prompt response actions.

### 2.2 Scope
- **Backend AI/ML Training:** Develop and train a neural network model using labeled images (fire vs. no fire).
- **Inference Engine:** Create an interface that accepts image input and outputs a classification.
- **Real-time Webcam Integration:** Extend the system to capture and process frames from a webcam for live detection.
- **Future Expansion:** Ensure the system is modular to facilitate a future deployment on Raspberry Pi with a camera module.

## 3. Definitions and Abbreviations

- **Wildfire:** An image that contains signs of fire in a forested area.
- **No Fire:** An image that shows a forest with no signs of fire.
- **ML:** Machine Learning.
- **AI:** Artificial Intelligence.
- **CLI:** Command-Line Interface.
- **API:** Application Programming Interface.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
- **FR1:** The system must load images from predefined directories (e.g., `/data/fire/` and `/data/no_fire/`).
- **FR2:** Preprocess the images (resize, normalization, data augmentation as necessary) to prepare them for training.

### 4.2 Model Training
- **FR3:** Define and implement a neural network model (using frameworks such as TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch) for binary classification.
- **FR4:** Train the model using the provided labeled images.
- **FR5:** Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets.
- **FR6:** Save the trained model to disk for later use in inference.

### 4.3 Inference (Backend)
- **FR7:** Develop an interface (CLI and/or API) that accepts a single image (or a batch of images) and returns a classification result (fire / no fire).
- **FR8:** Log the input, output, and any errors for future reference.

### 4.4 Webcam Integration (Phase 2)
- **FR9:** Integrate with a webcam to capture live video.
- **FR10:** Process individual frames in real time using the trained model.
- **FR11:** Display the real-time classification result on-screen, with an option to log detections.

### 4.5 Future Raspberry Pi Deployment (Phase 3)
- **FR12:** Ensure that the codebase is modular and abstracted so that the webcam functionality can be replaced with Raspberry Pi camera input without significant rewrites.
- **Note:** No Raspberry Pi-specific code is required in the current implementation.

---

## 5. Non-functional Requirements

- **NFR1: Performance:**  
  The system should process single images or video frames in near real time (e.g., achieving at least 1 frame per second during webcam processing).

- **NFR2: Accuracy:**  
  The model should reach a minimum baseline accuracy (e.g., 80% on the validation set) and provide clear metrics (precision, recall, F1 score) upon evaluation.

- **NFR3: Scalability and Extensibility:**  
  The system must be built in a modular fashion, making it easy to update the model, add new data sources, or integrate additional functionalities (such as cloud notifications).

- **NFR4: Maintainability:**  
  The code should be well-documented, use consistent coding standards, and include inline comments and a README.

- **NFR5: Portability:**  
  The software must run on Python 3.x and be deployable across different environments (development machine, production server, Raspberry Pi in future).

## 6. Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python (Python 3.x)
- **AI/ML Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (choose one based on team preference)
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV (for webcam frame capture and processing)
- **Other Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas (if needed), and scikit-learn (for additional metrics or preprocessing)
- **Development Tools:** Jupyter Notebook (optional for experimentation), Git for version control

## 7. System Architecture

### 7.1 Modules Overview
1. **Data Module:**
   - Handles image loading, preprocessing, and augmentation.

   - Contains model definition, training loops, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
3. **Inference Module:**
   - Provides functions or API endpoints for classifying images using the saved model.
4. **Deployment Module:**
   - For Phase 2: Integrates webcam functionality using OpenCV to capture and process live video frames.
   - For Phase 3: The module should be easily adaptable for Raspberry Pi camera input.

### 7.2 Data Flow

   - Apply preprocessing steps (e.g., resizing, normalization, augmentation).

2. **Model Definition & Training:**
   - Define the architecture of the neural network.
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets.
